## 8. Evaluation Metrics

### 8.1 Clustering Quality Metrics

#### Silhouette Score

**Definition**: Measures how well each sample fits within its cluster compared to other clusters.

**Mathematical Formula**:
```
For each sample i:
  a(i) = average distance to other samples in same cluster
  b(i) = average distance to samples in nearest different cluster

  s(i) = (b(i) - a(i)) / max(a(i), b(i))

Silhouette Score = average(s(i) for all samples)
```

**Interpretation**:
- **Range**: -1 to +1
- **+1**: Sample is far from neighboring clusters (perfect)
- **0**: Sample is on the border between two clusters
- **-1**: Sample may be assigned to wrong cluster

**Example**:
```python
# Customer in Cluster A
a(customer) = 0.5  # Average distance to other Cluster A members
b(customer) = 1.2  # Average distance to nearest cluster (B)

s(customer) = (1.2 - 0.5) / max(0.5, 1.2) = 0.7 / 1.2 = 0.58 (Good)
```

**Typical Values**:
- 0.71-1.0: Strong structure
- 0.51-0.70: Reasonable structure
- 0.26-0.50: Weak structure, some overlap
- < 0.25: No substantial structure

**Our Results**: ~0.30 (weak to reasonable structure)
- Indicates some cluster overlap
- Common for complex customer data
- Better than random assignment

#### Davies-Bouldin Score

**Definition**: Ratio of within-cluster distances to between-cluster distances.

**Mathematical Formula**:
```
For each cluster i:
  s_i = average distance from samples to centroid i

For each pair (i,j):
  M_ij = distance between centroids i and j
  R_ij = (s_i + s_j) / M_ij

Davies-Bouldin = (1/K) Σᵢ max_j(R_ij)
```

**Interpretation**:
- **Range**: 0 to ∞
- **Lower is better**
- 0 = perfect separation (unrealistic)
- Measures worst-case cluster similarity

**Example**:
```python
Cluster A: s_A = 0.5
Cluster B: s_B = 0.6
Distance between centroids: M_AB = 2.0

R_AB = (0.5 + 0.6) / 2.0 = 0.55 (Good - low value)
```

**Typical Values**:
- < 1.0: Good separation
- 1.0-2.0: Moderate separation
- > 2.0: Poor separation

**Our Results**: ~1.10 (moderate separation)
- Clusters are reasonably distinct
- Some overlap between similar customer groups
- Acceptable for real-world segmentation

#### Calinski-Harabasz Score (Variance Ratio Criterion)

**Definition**: Ratio of between-cluster dispersion to within-cluster dispersion.

**Mathematical Formula**:
```
SSB = Σₖ nₖ × ||μₖ - μ||²  (Between-cluster sum of squares)
SSW = Σₖ Σᵢ∈Cₖ ||xᵢ - μₖ||²  (Within-cluster sum of squares)

CH = (SSB / (K-1)) / (SSW / (N-K))

where:
- K = number of clusters
- N = number of samples
- nₖ = number of samples in cluster k
- μₖ = centroid of cluster k
- μ = overall mean
```

**Interpretation**:
- **Range**: 0 to ∞
- **Higher is better**
- Larger values indicate better-defined clusters
- Balances cluster compactness and separation

**Example**:
```python
# Well-separated clusters
SSB = 10000 (high between-cluster variance)
SSW = 2000  (low within-cluster variance)
N = 8068, K = 7

CH = (10000/6) / (2000/8061) = 1666.7 / 0.248 = 6720 (Excellent)

# Poorly separated clusters
SSB = 2000
SSW = 10000
CH = (2000/6) / (10000/8061) = 333.3 / 1.240 = 269 (Poor)
```

**Typical Values**:
- No universal threshold
- Compare across different K values
- Higher values indicate better clustering

**Our Results**: ~1200-1500 (reasonable)
- Indicates clusters are distinct from overall mean
- Better than random assignment
- Reasonable for customer segmentation

#### Inertia (Within-Cluster Sum of Squares)

**Definition**: Sum of squared distances from each sample to its cluster centroid.

**Mathematical Formula**:
```
Inertia = Σₖ Σᵢ∈Cₖ ||xᵢ - μₖ||²

where:
- Cₖ = cluster k
- xᵢ = sample i
- μₖ = centroid of cluster k
```

**Interpretation**:
- **Range**: 0 to ∞
- **Lower is better**
- Measures cluster compactness
- Decreases as K increases (overfitting risk)

**Use Case**: Elbow method for finding optimal K
```python
K_values = [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
Inertias = [15000, 12000, 10000, 8500, 7500, 7000, 6800, 6700, 6650]

# Plot shows "elbow" at K=7
# After K=7, diminishing returns (curve flattens)
```

**Limitations**:
- Always favors larger K
- Need other metrics to balance
- Not normalized (depends on dataset scale)

### 8.2 Reconstruction Quality Metrics

#### Mean Squared Error (MSE)

**Definition**: Average squared difference between input and reconstructed output.

**Formula**:
```
MSE = (1/n) Σᵢ (input_i - reconstructed_i)²
```

**Usage in Auto Encoder**:
- Training loss function
- Measures reconstruction quality
- Lower MSE = better compression

**Example**:
```python
Input:    [0.5, -1.2, 0.8, ..., -0.3]  (9 features)
Reconstructed: [0.48, -1.15, 0.82, ..., -0.28]

MSE = [(0.5-0.48)² + (-1.2-(-1.15))² + ...] / 9
    = [0.0004 + 0.0025 + ...] / 9
    = 0.0856

# Lower MSE indicates better reconstruction
```

**Typical Values**:
- Depends on data scale
- After standardization: 0.5-1.5 (reasonable)
- < 0.5 (excellent), > 2.0 (poor)

**Our Results**: ~0.90 (good reconstruction)

#### Mean Absolute Error (MAE)

**Definition**: Average absolute difference between input and reconstruction.

**Formula**:
```
MAE = (1/n) Σᵢ |input_i - reconstructed_i|
```

**Advantages over MSE**:
- More interpretable (same units as data)
- Less sensitive to outliers
- Direct measure of average error

**Typical Values**:
- After standardization: 0.3-0.8 (reasonable)
- < 0.3 (excellent), > 1.0 (poor)

### 8.3 Visualization Metrics

#### t-SNE Perplexity

**Definition**: Balance between local and global structure preservation.

**Default**: 30
**Range**: 5-50
**Effect**:
- Low (5-10): Focuses on local structure
- Medium (20-40): Balanced view
- High (50+): Emphasizes global structure

#### PCA Explained Variance

**Definition**: Proportion of variance captured by each principal component.

**Example**:
```python
PC1: 35.2% variance explained
PC2: 22.8% variance explained
Total (2D): 58.0% of variance captured

# 58% means 2D plot captures majority of information
# Remaining 42% is in dimensions 3-8
```

**Interpretation**:
- > 70%: Excellent 2D representation
- 50-70%: Good representation
- < 50%: May miss important structure

## 11. Advanced Topics

### 11.1 Model Tuning and Optimization

#### Hyperparameter Tuning

**Auto Encoder Architecture**:

```python
# Tested Configurations:

Configuration 1: Narrow
[9] → [12] → [8] → [12] → [9]
Results: MSE=1.02, Silhouette=0.28

Configuration 2: Wide
[9] → [32] → [16] → [8] → [16] → [32] → [9]
Results: MSE=0.87, Silhouette=0.31

Configuration 3: Deep
[9] → [16] → [12] → [10] → [8] → [10] → [12] → [16] → [9]
Results: MSE=0.91, Silhouette=0.30

Configuration 4: Selected (Balanced)
[9] → [16] → [12] → [8] → [12] → [16] → [9]
Results: MSE=0.90, Silhouette=0.30
```

**Selection Rationale**:
- Configuration 4 balances complexity and performance
- Fewer parameters than Wide, better than Narrow
- Simpler than Deep, similar performance
- Lower overfitting risk

**Encoding Dimension Testing**:

```python
# Impact of Latent Space Size:

Encoding_Dim=4:  MSE=1.15, Silhouette=0.26 (Too compressed)
Encoding_Dim=6:  MSE=0.98, Silhouette=0.28 (Better)
Encoding_Dim=8:  MSE=0.90, Silhouette=0.30 (Optimal)
Encoding_Dim=10: MSE=0.88, Silhouette=0.29 (Marginal improvement)
Encoding_Dim=12: MSE=0.86, Silhouette=0.28 (Overfitting)
```

**Selection**: Encoding_Dim=8
- Best silhouette score
- Significant compression (9 → 8)
- Reasonable reconstruction (MSE=0.90)
- Prevents overfitting

#### Optimal K Selection

**Elbow Method Analysis**:

```python
K_values = [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
Inertias = [15234, 12456, 10234, 8765, 7543, 6987, 6756, 6623, 6545]

# Percentage drop in inertia:
K=2→3: 18.2%
K=3→4: 17.8%
K=4→5: 14.4%
K=5→6: 13.9%
K=6→7: 7.4% ← Elbow point
K=7→8: 3.3%
K=8→9: 2.0%
K=9→10: 1.2%
```

**Silhouette Analysis**:

```python
K=2: Silhouette=0.42 (Too broad)
K=3: Silhouette=0.38
K=4: Silhouette=0.35
K=5: Silhouette=0.32
K=6: Silhouette=0.31
K=7: Silhouette=0.30 ← Best balance
K=8: Silhouette=0.28
K=9: Silhouette=0.26
K=10: Silhouette=0.24 (Over-segmentation)
```

**Selection**: K=7
- Elbow point (diminishing returns after K=7)
- Reasonable silhouette score
- Matches business requirement (7 segments)
- Manageable number of segments

### 11.2 Alternative Approaches

#### Variational Auto Encoder (VAE)

**Concept**: Probabilistic version of Auto Encoder

**Advantages**:
- Generates more robust latent representations
- Better handles uncertainty
- Can generate synthetic customers

**Implementation**:
```python
# Bottleneck becomes:
z_mean = Dense(8)(hidden)
z_log_var = Dense(8)(hidden)
z = Lambda(sampling)([z_mean, z_log_var])

# Loss becomes:
loss = reconstruction_loss + KL_divergence
```

**When to Use**:
- Need uncertainty estimates
- Want to generate synthetic data
- Have smaller datasets (regularization helps)

#### Deep Embedded Clustering (DEC)

**Concept**: Train clustering and feature learning jointly

**Advantages**:
- End-to-end optimization
- No separate clustering step
- Can improve clustering quality

**Implementation**:
```python
# Custom loss:
loss = reconstruction_loss + clustering_loss

# Clustering loss:
Q = student_t_distribution(features, centroids)
P = target_distribution(Q)
clustering_loss = KL_divergence(P, Q)
```

**When to Use**:
- Need maximum clustering performance
- Have computational resources
- Can sacrifice interpretability

#### Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM)

**Concept**: Probabilistic clustering with soft assignments

**Advantages**:
- Provides cluster probabilities
- Handles overlapping clusters
- More flexible cluster shapes

**Implementation**:
```python
from sklearn.mixture import GaussianMixture

gmm = GaussianMixture(n_components=7, covariance_type='full')
gmm.fit(encoded_features)
probabilities = gmm.predict_proba(encoded_features)
```

**When to Use**:
- Need probability of cluster membership
- Clusters have Gaussian shapes
- Want soft assignments

### 11.3 Scalability Considerations

#### Handling Larger Datasets

**Current Scale**: 8,068 training samples
**Target Scale**: 100,000+ samples

**Approach 1: Mini-Batch K-Means**
```python
from sklearn.cluster import MiniBatchKMeans

clusterer = MiniBatchKMeans(
    n_clusters=7,
    batch_size=1000,
    max_iter=100
)
# Much faster for large datasets
# Slight accuracy trade-off
```

**Approach 2: Online Learning**
```python
# Train Auto Encoder in batches
for epoch in range(epochs):
    for batch in data_generator:
        autoencoder.train_on_batch(batch, batch)
```

**Approach 3: Dimensionality Reduction First**
```python
# Use PCA to reduce from 9 → 6 features before Auto Encoder
from sklearn.decomposition import PCA
pca = PCA(n_components=6)
X_reduced = pca.fit_transform(X_train)
# Then train Auto Encoder on 6 features instead of 9
```

#### Distributed Computing

**Using Dask for Large Datasets**:
```python
import dask.dataframe as dd

# Load large CSV with Dask
df = dd.read_csv('large_customer_data.csv')

# Parallel preprocessing
df_processed = df.map_partitions(preprocess_function)

# Convert to Dask Array for scikit-learn
X = df_processed.to_dask_array(lengths=True)

# Use Dask-ML for clustering
from dask_ml.cluster import KMeans
clusterer = KMeans(n_clusters=7)
clusterer.fit(X)
```

**Using Spark for Big Data**:
```python
from pyspark.ml.clustering import KMeans as SparkKMeans

# Load data into Spark DataFrame
df = spark.read.csv('large_customer_data.csv', header=True)

# Feature engineering in Spark
assembler = VectorAssembler(inputCols=features, outputCol='features')
df_features = assembler.transform(df)

# Train clustering
kmeans = SparkKMeans(k=7, seed=42)
model = kmeans.fit(df_features)
```

### 11.4 Model Monitoring and Maintenance

#### Concept Drift Detection

**Problem**: Customer behavior changes over time
- New demographics emerge
- Preferences shift
- Economic conditions change

**Detection Methods**:

**1. Statistical Tests**:
```python
from scipy.stats import ks_2samp

# Compare new data distribution to training data
for feature in features:
    stat, p_value = ks_2samp(train_data[feature], new_data[feature])
    if p_value < 0.05:
        print(f"Drift detected in {feature}")
```

**2. Reconstruction Error Monitoring**:
```python
# Track Auto Encoder reconstruction error over time
new_errors = autoencoder.get_reconstruction_error(new_batches)

if mean(new_errors) > threshold * mean(training_errors):
    trigger_retraining()
```

**3. Cluster Stability**:
```python
# Monitor cluster size changes
current_distribution = cluster_sizes(new_data)
historical_distribution = cluster_sizes(training_data)

if wasserstein_distance(current, historical) > threshold:
    alert_drift()
```

#### Retraining Strategy

**Scheduled Retraining**:
```
- Retrain quarterly (every 3 months)
- Use rolling window (last 12 months of data)
- Compare performance before deploying new model
```

**Triggered Retraining**:
```
Triggers:
1. Drift detected (statistical tests)
2. Performance degradation (silhouette score drops)
3. New product launch (major market change)
4. Significant new data accumulated (>20% increase)
```

**A/B Testing**:
```
- Deploy new model to 20% of customers
- Compare business metrics (conversion, engagement)
- Gradual rollout if successful
- Rollback if performance degrades
```
